# NetCDF Why and How: Creating Publication Quality NetCDF
Content from the NASA Earthdata webinar presented by ORNL DAAC in September 2019.

## Overview       

In this webinar we introduce step-by-step methods, software, and tools that you canuse to create, visualize, and standardize netCDF files before submitting your data toan archive.The netCDF file format is a recommended format for archival and distribution of multi-dimensional and gridded geospatial data. However, creating and organizing standardized datasets can be challenging for researchers not experienced with netCDF. This webinar focuses on two main topics:
1. Why netCDF: What advantages does netCDF have that make it a suitable long-term archive and sharing format, and
2. How netCDF: How can you transform your data from other formats into standardized netCDF files.
